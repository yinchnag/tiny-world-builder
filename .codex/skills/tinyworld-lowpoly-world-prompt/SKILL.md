# Tiny World Low-Poly World Prompting

The built-in model should act like a compact low-poly diorama designer, not a random tile filler.

Prompt principles:

- Generate should be text-only by default: use OpenAI `gpt-5.5` for validated
  world JSON and do not add an image-generation topology prepass unless the
  user explicitly asks for images again.
- Honour the selected generation board size. The Generate dialog can request
  any `HOME_GRID_OPTIONS` size, so prompts must include the requested
  `gridSize` and coordinate bounds instead of assuming 8x8.
- Floating chat prompts are additive patches by default. Unless the prompt
  explicitly asks to replace/reset/rebuild or starts with `/clear`, preserve the
  existing board and return only complete final-state cells that should be
  added or changed.
- Start from a readable scene concept: village, farm, canal, ridge, market, castle, garden, or mixed landmark.
- Use strong silhouettes: tall/short contrast, clustered houses, towers, hills, trees, walls, and clear negative space.
- Make terrain do composition work: paths lead the eye, water creates crossings, dirt groups crops, grass gives breathing room.
- Treat hills and mountains as elevation/height through `terrainFloors`, not
  as a field of rock objects. Rocks are sparse landmarks or boulders only.
- Use adjacency intentionally: house clusters merge, fences connect, bridges belong on water crossings, crops form fields.
- Avoid noise: do not fill every board cell; leave open cells and visible paths.
- Use `floors` as variation/intensity, including terrain stacking and object detail.
- Use forced `buildingType` only when a distinct one-cell variant is wanted; otherwise leave houses as `buildingType: null` so cluster logic can work.
- Keep output strictly machine-parseable JSON matching the schema.

Primitive assembly prompting:

- Tell models they cannot invent new object kinds, meshes, labels, or custom geometry in JSON.
- Ask them to translate broad environments into available primitives: terrain, raised terrainFloors, houses/building variants, fences/fenceSide, rocks, bridges, crops, tufts, and trees.
- Treat native primitives as scene components, not the creativity ceiling. If the user asks for a distinct object with no native kind, author it as a `customParts` voxel-build hero cell instead of reducing it to rocks, houses, or terrain.
- Include concrete decompositions for non-native requests:
  - skate park = path/dirt plaza + raised terrain ramps + rocks as obstacles + fences as rails/edges + tufts/trees as landscaping.
  - market = path plaza + cottage/manor stalls + fences as queue rails + crops/pumpkins as goods.
  - playground = path/dirt base + rocks as play forms + fences as boundary + trees/tufts for park context.
  - quarry = raised dirt/grass terraces + rocks of varied floors + path access road + sparse tufts.
- Emphasize legibility from the default isometric camera: 3–5 clear assembled features beats many scattered cells.

Voxel stamp prompting:

- For new text/image-to-voxel stamps, prefer semantic `customParts` first instead
  of raw voxel clouds. This preserves editable object structure and avoids
  low-quality broad blocks.
- Include the allowed material list, selected/source object intent, source
  parts when available, image reference when present, `allowedBounds`, and a
  quality target that calls out connected layered detail.
- For bespoke requests such as glass greenhouse, dome, vehicle, robot, or
  airship, require semantic colored parts and at least several material
  families. Native houses/fences/rocks are allowed only when they are actual
  components or surroundings, not substitutes for the requested model.
- Use `customParts` `kind: "cable"` for ropes, balloon basket lines, tethers,
  rigging, and mooring-style connections. Cable parts need `from`/`to`
  endpoints, radius, sag, and the usual compatibility `size`/`pos`/`scale`.
- Use `sphere`/`ellipsoid` custom parts for rounded envelopes, domes, tanks,
  and canopies. A hot-air balloon should have a rounded ellipsoid/sphere
  envelope with colored fabric panel bands, not a box body. Use
  `phiStart`/`phiLength` ellipsoid slices for curved balloon panels instead of
  flat rectangular plates.
- Keep first-pass generated custom models to sane board scale. Use
  `customFootprint` around 1.1-1.3 for compact props, bridges, decks, and
  docks; reserve 1.5-1.8 for clear hero objects such as balloons, airships,
  domes, and greenhouses. For bridges/decks that need to sit into water or
  terrain, prefer a small negative `transform.offsetY` instead of making the
  geometry oversized.
- Explicitly tell models not to default `customParts` to stone/rock unless the
  requested object is stone. Prefer TinyWorld material names such as `wood`,
  `brass`, `copper`, `metal`, `steel`, `glass`, `glassGreen`, `fabric`,
  `canvas`, `rope`, `cable`, and accent colors.
- Use raw `{x,y,z,color}` voxels after a seed exists and the user asks to
  reinterpret/upscale/refine density; keep returned voxels bounded and omit
  hidden interior fill.
- Do not let a reference image or prior Japanese stamp bias unrelated objects
  into pagodas, gardens, torii, sakura, or shrine motifs unless explicitly
  requested.

For Auto suggestions:

- Return candidate actions, not coordinates.
- Suggestions should be reusable across several placements.
- Include a varied ranked batch: one structural option, one terrain/path option, one nature/detail option, and one intensify/repeat option when useful.

Offline random island generation:

- `generateProceduralWorld()` is the public entry point used by the Generate
  panel and command palette, but it delegates to `generateRandomIslandWorld()`.
- The random island generator ports the `tiny-markov/island-lab` flow into
  TinyWorld schema cells: connected island mask, archetype terrain/object
  weights, water/bridge/path passes, then a deliberate token-to-native mapping.
- Keep emitted cells complete v4 object cells: `x`, `z`, `terrain`, `kind`,
  `floors`, `terrainFloors`, `buildingType`, and `fenceSide`.
- Map lab-only tokens explicitly to real renderer support. Examples:
  watchtower/castle -> `kind:"house"` with `buildingType:"tower"`,
  manor -> `kind:"house"` with `buildingType:"manor"`, lamp -> `lamp-post`,
  berries -> `bush`, ore -> `crystal`, water-bridge -> `bridge` on water.
  Do not invent unsupported `kind` values just because the lab catalogue has
  a matching label.
- Generated placed objects should set `appearance.objectStyle = "voxel"` so
  the in-app test exercises the existing voxel asset factories instead of the
  standalone lab's flat preview tokens.
- Archetypes are authored through a deterministic feature-grammar pass before
  residual scatter. Preserve that meaning layer: pastoral = enclosed fields and
  pasture, forest = grove/trail, quarry = connected stone/ore seam, river =
  crossing plus irrigated bank, village = plaza/roads/house block, fortress =
  keep/wall/gate, ruins = relic cluster, harbor = shore/dock/inland path. Do
  not regress this to pure weighted random placement.
- Resource placement has a dedicated semantic pass after archetype grammar and
  before residual scatter. Crops should read as fenced plots, animals as fenced
  pens, homes/manors as path-connected places, trees/berries as groves,
  stone/crystal as seams, and ruins/totems as relic sites. Residual scatter is
  for small accents only, not the primary source of meaningful resources.
- Towers are owned by the corner landmark pass, not by archetype scatter:
  generated `watchtower`/`castle` tokens should resolve to corner-adjacent
  `kind:"house", buildingType:"tower"` cells with the count profile
  0/1/2/3/4 = 6.25%/50%/25%/12.5%/6.25%.
- Terrain is also composed through motifs before paths and object placement:
  broad land terrain comes from deterministic smooth noise fields, then water
  gets one protected composition motif (edge inlet, lake, or river) plus a small
  edge-water bias instead of a moat-like fill. Stone gets ridge/seam walks,
  dirt/prairie get field/meadow patches, and sand grows from shoreline
  adjacency. Keep this motif layer ahead of archetype object grammar so terrain
  meaning supports the later props.
- Water bridges are a late validation layer, not a water decoration. Put rivers
  or lakes down first, carve/extend path roads next, then place `water-bridge`
  only when the water cell has `path` on opposite banks horizontally or
  vertically and water continues under the bridge on the perpendicular axis.
  A harbor edge/dock should use waterfront path/shore composition unless it is
  a true road crossing over a visible water channel.
- Keep generated large building variants spaced out. Lab tokens that map to
  forced TinyWorld house variants (`manor`, `watchtower`/`castle` -> tower-like
  houses) need a buffer from ordinary house clusters because their rendered
  meshes can occupy more visual footprint than one logical cell.
- The world menu's `New world` action is the in-app Tinyverse-style test path
  for the offline generator: it chooses a random archetype/seed, applies the
  generated TinyWorld state, saves it as a named local world slot, then opens
  the cinematic economy reveal. Keep economy scoring derived from the loaded
  TinyWorld cells, not from pre-mapping lab tokens, so the stats describe the
  real rendered assets.
- Economy reveal profile data comes from `buildRandomIslandEconomyProfile()`.
  It mirrors island-lab's Food / Materials / Commerce / Defense / Charm,
  gold/day, rarity, traits, synergies, and feature highlight groups, but it is
  presentation/runtime data rather than part of the saved world schema.
  Rarity is archetype-relative after normalized scoring so a strong forest or
  ruins island can be rare without needing village-level absolute commerce.
- Random-island statistical profiles should be produced with
  `npm run stats:random-island -- --samples=10000`. Each run writes a
  timestamped JSON artifact under ignored `stats-runs/random-island/` and
  refreshes `stats-runs/random-island/latest.json`.
- Random-island visual/aesthetic samples should be produced with
  `npm run sample:random-island -- --count=16`. Each run writes seeds, terrain
  glyph maps, water components, economy profile data, and full world JSON under
  ignored `random-island-runs/`.
